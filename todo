- reducing the number of children in a pnode doesn't do anything
- add exporting a local node to a template
- right clicking to add nodes doesn't add them to correct mouse position
- add ability to analize similar unprocessed text to group together different parser nodes
- sampling cards doesn't work?
- creashed several times when opening and directly opening the counter-type parser AND what-in-cost parser (fix: first open root, then bake, then open the needed parser)
- changing the name of the parser doesn't update it in the context menu
- text transformers don't seem to be updating after updating their scripts
- increasing selector count by more than 1 increases only once

- implement node copying

Parsers:
- has more life is kinda wonky
- gain life - replace who with something else
- remove ... from this artifact you control, remove ... from [cardname] you control - kinda funny but still bad
- remove -1/+1 counter from another [type:enchantment] you control: yous gain 1 life
- where x is ... target - don't know if legal by rules to reference a target in where clause
- whenever you cast spell each turn - BAD
- whenever equipped merfolk die - BAD, but don't know how to fix
