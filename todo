- reducing the number of children in a selector doesn't do anything
- add exporting a local node to a template
- right clicking to add nodes doesn't add them to correct mouse position
- add ability to analize similar unprocessed text to group together different parser nodes
- sampling cards doesn't work?
- creating a local matcher with no capture groups doesn't have an input
- creashed several times when opening and directly opening the counter-type parser AND what-in-cost parser (fix: first open root, then bake, then open the needed parser)
- changing the name of the parser doesn't update it in the context menu

- implement node copying
