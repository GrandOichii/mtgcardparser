-= MTG Card Parser =-

Uses MTG cards and converts them to an XML format, then using that format converts them to scripts (could be used for Forge or some other future engine).

Has to load a project, the projects represents the way the cards are transformed.

Tabs:
    Cards:
        The list of all cards, present locally.
    Text Transformer Pipelines:
        A list of transformers, applied to the card text, using the whole card. 
        (Example: replace all card name instances with CARDNAME)
    Parsing Tree:
        The actual process of parsing the text, transformed using pipeline into the XML format.
    Templates:
        The templates for the main parsing tree. Has the same editor as the main parsing tree.



Front features:
    Text transformer result text coloring - a separate tab for configuring all the colors for the surrounders used in the templates
    (Example: [mana:rrr] -> [color=red]rrr[/color])
